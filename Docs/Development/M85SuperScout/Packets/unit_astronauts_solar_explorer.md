# Solar Explorer — T082 Super Scout packet

**Stable ID:** `unit.astronauts.solar_explorer`

**Packet state:** `IDENTITY_BASELINE — HOLD FOR MULTI-ANGLE EVIDENCE`

**This is not a design approval or production-model authorization.**

## A. Identity and authority

- Faction: `Astronauts`
- Kind: `Unit`
- Gameplay role: Forward service / refit
- Authoritative footprint: `Large`
- Source classification: `OFFICIAL-ADAPTED`
- Approved source sets/motifs: 7315
- Current confidence: verified canonical identity; construction confidence remains bounded by the source verification shown below.

Authoritative references:

- `Docs/Canon/00_CANON_SET_REGISTRY.md`
- `Docs/Canon/03_UNIT_BUILDING_ROSTER.md`
- `Docs/Canon/09C_FULL_CONTENT_AND_PRESENTATION_PRODUCTION_AMENDMENT.md`
- `Content/PrototypeEntities.json`

Open question: Source-view coverage and construction-critical page ranges are recorded for the audited sources below. Asset-specific adaptation boundaries still must be resolved before this packet can leave HOLD.

### Source audit [Astronauts:7315]

- Evidence state: `OFFICIAL_PDF_VISUALLY_AUDITED`
- Construction map:
  - PDF pages 2-7: Forward cockpit and low exploration nose module.
  - PDF pages 8-17: Long modular habitation/cargo body plus separate small support pod.
  - PDF pages 18-23: Twin-panel solar/service tail built around a tall circular frame and attached to the long body.
  - PDF pages 24-26: Cross-set alternate models and extended modular combinations; not direct production geometry.
- View/mechanism coverage: front=VERIFIED p1 and p22-23; rear=PARTIAL p18-23; leftRight=VERIFIED p2-23; top=VERIFIED p2-23; threeQuarter=VERIFIED p1 and p22-26; undersideInterior=VERIFIED p2-21 staged construction; mechanism=PARTIAL p18-23 separable solar/service module; deployment not demonstrated
- Verified findings:
  - Solar Explorer identity comes from a long low modular convoy body rather than a single compact rover.
  - The rear service section carries two broad solar wings around a tall circular machinery frame.
  - Cockpit, habitat/cargo body, support pod and solar tail remain independently readable modules.
- Remaining evidence gaps:
  - The manual supports separable modules but not the game's deployed Forward Service state; stabilizers, access route and deployment motion remain explicit adaptation work.

Any `PARTIAL` or `MISSING` view remains an explicit gap. One flattering three-quarter image is never sufficient.

## C. Recognition contract

**Silhouette thesis:** A long modular field convoy visually bookended by broad solar panels and separable service sections.

Non-removable identity anchors:

- large paired solar wings
- long multi-module chassis
- visible detachable service module

- Near / standard / far silhouette thumbnails: `PENDING 24/44/72-CELL BOARD`.
- Palette and material hierarchy: Field Systems retain rugged white/light-gray/medium-blue construction; Mission Systems retain clean white/orange/black construction. Shared identity comes from insignia and interfaces, not shape averaging.
- Forbidden genericization: Do not blend the two source lineages into generic white sci-fi or add military forms unsupported by the mapped expedition function.
- Nearest-confusion baseline:

- `unit.astronauts.mx81_operations_aircraft` — Both are large modular Astronaut support assets. Mitigations: Solar Explorer is a long ground convoy; MX-81 is a very wide true-air wing. / Solar Explorer is bookended by flat solar panels; MX-81 carries several detachable mission pods. / Solar Explorer retains rugged Field construction; MX-81 uses clean high-performance Mission geometry.

## D. Construction contract

- Hero geometry must preserve every recognition anchor above.
- Support geometry must explain how hero masses connect, carry load and articulate.
- Micro geometry may enrich close view but may not become required for recognition.
- Exact chassis/load path, repeated modules, mounting logic, scale ratios and approved adaptations: `HOLD — SOURCE DECOMPOSITION REQUIRED`.

## E. Material and texture contract

- Silhouette, openings, major panel breaks, moving joints and LEGO connection logic remain geometry.
- Surface channels may carry controlled color masks, roughness, emission, decals and non-structural relief only.
- Required reusable and bespoke texture sets, resolution, tiling, texel density, LOD fallback and import settings: `HOLD — TEXTURE-NEEDS AUDIT REQUIRED`.
- Baked lighting, fake silhouette structure and illegible micro-noise are prohibited.

## F. State and animation contract

- Applicable idle, locomotion/operation, work, attack, production, repair, transform/deploy, disabled, damage and destruction beats: `HOLD — MECHANISM EVIDENCE REQUIRED`.
- Every moving assembly must receive a named pivot, parent, axis/path, rest/extreme poses and authoritative presentation driver.
- Animation may communicate gameplay state but never decide gameplay timing.

## G. Presentation hookups

- `Socket_Selection` and `Socket_Health` are mandatory.
- Tool, weapon, projectile, VFX, lamp and audio sockets follow only from verified function.
- Cargo, passenger, service, production-exit or network sockets apply where the canonical role requires them.
- Identification Tile, icon silhouette, portrait camera and reduced-presentation fallback: `HOLD — PRESENTATION AUDIT REQUIRED`.

## H. Insight and decision ledger

- Verified fact: stable identity, faction, role, footprint, source classification and mapped source family.
- Canon-derived interpretation: silhouette thesis and identity anchors above.
- Unknown: exact multi-angle construction, articulation, material ratios, texture inventory and confusion mitigation until the remaining audits are complete.
- Consequential contradictions: none recorded at identity-baseline stage.

## I. Build handoff

1. Verify and cite the complete multi-angle source board.
2. Decompose primary masses and negative spaces from orthogonal evidence.
3. Resolve LEGO load path, connection grammar and moving mechanism.
4. Complete material/texture and state/animation contracts.
5. Produce 24/44/72-cell black silhouettes and run the cross-roster confusion audit.

**State:** `HOLD`
