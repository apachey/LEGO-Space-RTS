### Source audit [Astronauts:7315]

- Evidence state: `OFFICIAL_PDF_VISUALLY_AUDITED`
- Evidence links: [official instruction PDF 1](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/4130810.pdf)
- Construction map:
  - Evidence pages 2-7: Forward cockpit and low exploration nose module.
  - Evidence pages 8-17: Long modular habitation/cargo body plus separate small support pod.
  - Evidence pages 18-23: Twin-panel solar/service tail built around a tall circular frame and attached to the long body.
  - Evidence pages 24-26: Cross-set alternate models and extended modular combinations; not direct production geometry.
- View/mechanism coverage: front=VERIFIED p1 and p22-23; rear=PARTIAL p18-23; leftRight=VERIFIED p2-23; top=VERIFIED p2-23; threeQuarter=VERIFIED p1 and p22-26; undersideInterior=VERIFIED p2-21 staged construction; mechanism=PARTIAL p18-23 separable solar/service module; deployment not demonstrated
- Verified findings:
  - Solar Explorer identity comes from a long low modular convoy body rather than a single compact rover.
  - The rear service section carries two broad solar wings around a tall circular machinery frame.
  - Cockpit, habitat/cargo body, support pod and solar tail remain independently readable modules.
- Remaining evidence gaps:
  - The manual supports separable modules but not the game's deployed Forward Service state; stabilizers, access route and deployment motion remain explicit adaptation work.

### Source audit [Astronauts:7690]

- Evidence state: `OFFICIAL_PDF_VISUALLY_AUDITED`
- Evidence links: [official instruction PDF 1](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/4523177.pdf), [official instruction PDF 2](https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/4523179.pdf)
- Construction map:
  - Evidence pages book 1, 3-15: Alien scout craft; supporting opposition evidence.
  - Evidence pages book 1, 16-49: Compact astronaut drilling/transfer station, pressure tank, hoses and material routes.
  - Evidence pages book 1, 50-75; book 2, 2-31: Tall open A-frame service gantry, crane/transfer boom and elevated mission modules.
  - Evidence pages book 2, 32-68: Long white/orange shuttle assembled and suspended within the gantry.
  - Evidence pages book 2, 69-72: Final base-wide views and explicit crane/transfer interaction.
- View/mechanism coverage: front=VERIFIED book 2 p23-72; rear=VERIFIED book 2 p26-72; leftRight=VERIFIED both books; top=VERIFIED book 2 p17-72; threeQuarter=VERIFIED covers and book 2 p29-72; undersideInterior=VERIFIED staged open gantry and shuttle construction; mechanism=VERIFIED book 1 p47-49 and book 2 p23-31 transfer hoses/crane; PARTIAL shuttle service cycle
- Verified findings:
  - MB-01 is an open mission complex dominated by a tall white A-frame gantry rather than an enclosed headquarters block.
  - A separate drilling/transfer station, pressure tank and routed hoses make resources and service physically legible.
  - The long shuttle hangs inside the gantry with visible overhead and side access, establishing a reusable Command Base, refit and flight-service grammar.
- Remaining evidence gaps:
  - The source combines command, extraction and shuttle service in one playset; the game's Command Base, Refit Hub and Sentinel adaptations still need explicit boundaries between shared modules.

Any `PARTIAL` or `MISSING` view remains an explicit gap. One flattering three-quarter image is never sufficient.

**Source-decomposition rule:** A source set is a container of models, figures, equipment and detachable modules, not an automatic one-to-one unit mapping. Any composed design must disclose its exact donor components, adaptation and rejected alternatives before director approval.

## C. Recognition contract

**Silhouette thesis:** A modular service ring where Field and Mission machines visibly dock to standardized interfaces.

Non-removable identity anchors:

- central refit turntable
- contrasting Field and Mission docking arms
- visible replacement-module racks

- Blind-review code: `S06`. Draft boards: [24-cell](../Silhouettes/blind_24_cells.svg), [44-cell](../Silhouettes/blind_44_cells.svg), [72-cell](../Silhouettes/blind_72_cells.svg). This is a concept silhouette, not an approved model.
- Palette and material hierarchy: Field Systems retain rugged white/light-gray/medium-blue construction; Mission Systems retain clean white/orange/black construction. Shared identity comes from insignia and interfaces, not shape averaging.
- Forbidden genericization: Do not blend the two source lineages into generic white sci-fi or add military forms unsupported by the mapped expedition function.
- Nearest-confusion baseline:

- `building.ast.flight_operations_pad` — Both are broad open Astronaut service surfaces. Mitigations: Flight Pad is flat and strongly directional; Refit Hub is a circular docking arrangement. / Flight Pad uses retractable aircraft service arms; Refit Hub uses contrasting Field and Mission docking arms. / Flight Pad culminates in a beacon; Refit Hub culminates in a replacement-module turntable.

## D. Construction contract

- Contract state: `CANON_DERIVED_ADAPTATION`. This is an internally checked draft, not game-director approval.
- Semantic part map:
  - Central refit turntable — establishes one standardized service datum — CANON_DERIVED_ADAPTATION.
  - Contrasting Field and Mission docking arms — visibly bridge both equipment lineages — SOURCE_VERIFIED/CANON_DERIVED_ADAPTATION.
  - Replacement-module racks — make refit a physical exchange rather than a magic effect — SOURCE_VERIFIED/CANON_DERIVED_ADAPTATION.
- Structural load path: A broad planted ring carries the turntable; radial service arms and racks remain outside vehicle ingress paths.
- Repeated modules / connection grammar: Turntable, Field arm, Mission arm, module racks and technology console use shared docking interfaces.
- Source-faithful versus adapted boundary: 7315 and 7690 provide service grammar, but the combined hub is new composition and requires donor disclosure.

## E. Material and texture contract

- Geometry must carry:
  - central turntable
  - contrasting docking arms
  - visible module racks
- Accepted master-material roles: `Body`, `Accent`, `Tool`, `Rubber`, `Glass`, `Signal`, `Lamp`, `Neutral`.
- Reusable texture requirements:
  - `ast_field_frame_surface` — Restrained molded and brushed variation for rugged blue-gray Field Systems frames without faking structural seams. Channels: Tangent-space normal and linear roughness; body color stays parametric. Resolution: 2048x2048; texel density: 256 px/m at Close; tiling: Shared model-space 3 m repeat across connected frames.; LOD fallback: Half strength at Combat; master roughness only at Strategic. Provenance/state: Project-authored procedural source informed by verified Field Systems surfaces; human review required. `SPECIFIED_NOT_AUTHORED`.
  - `ast_mission_shell_surface` — Very subtle clean-shell roughness variation for white-orange Mission Systems hulls without weathering them into Raider machinery. Channels: Tangent-space normal and linear roughness; no photographic albedo or baked highlights. Resolution: 2048x2048; texel density: 256 px/m at Close; tiling: Shared model-space 4 m repeat with continuous phase across large shells.; LOD fallback: Normal removed at Strategic; clean master-material blocks remain. Provenance/state: Project-authored procedural source informed by verified Mission Systems panels; human review required. `SPECIFIED_NOT_AUTHORED`.
  - `ast_service_insignia_decals` — Expedition insignia, docking marks, module IDs, service arrows and broad safety bands. Channels: sRGB RGBA decal atlas; alpha is coverage only. Resolution: 1024x1024; texel density: Minimum 256 px/m for Close/Combat readable marks; tiling: Atlas placement; only broad authored bands may repeat.; LOD fallback: Keep insignia and large docking bands at Combat; remove labels at Strategic. Provenance/state: Project-authored vector master exported to raster; human review required. `SPECIFIED_NOT_AUTHORED`.
  - `ast_console_signal_atlas` — Navigation, scan, refit, extraction and flight-operation displays plus bounded status lights. Channels: sRGB color/alpha with separate linear emission mask. Resolution: 1024x1024; texel density: Screen-space atlas; not world-density bound.; tiling: Non-tiling stable panel IDs shared by Field and Mission variants.; LOD fallback: Replace panels with one bounded Signal or Lamp block at Strategic. Provenance/state: Project-authored vector/procedural source; human review required. `SPECIFIED_NOT_AUTHORED`.
- Bespoke texture requirements: none required in this faction draft.
- Baked lighting, fake silhouette structure, per-part texture phase resets and illegible micro-noise remain prohibited.

## F. State and animation contract

- Locomotion / operation: Stationary structure.
- Planted/contact rule: Ring and outer arm bases remain planted; vehicle center stays clear.

| Pivot | Parent | Axis/path and rest-to-extreme motion | Presentation driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Pivot_RefitTurntable` | Asset_ServiceRefitHub | bounded indexing rotation | authoritative refit progress |
| `Pivot_FieldArm` | Asset_ServiceRefitHub | rack-to-docking arc | repair/refit progress |
| `Pivot_MissionArm` | Asset_ServiceRefitHub | opposed docking arc | repair/refit progress |

- Required beats:
  - Idle arms parked by lineage.
  - Repair brings one arm to contact.
  - Refit stages old/new modules and indexes turntable.
  - Damage disables an arm; destruction scatters inert modules.
- Animation consumes authoritative state and never decides gameplay timing or results.

## G. Presentation hookups

- Required presentation sockets: `Socket_Selection`, `Socket_Health`, `Socket_Service`, `Socket_Refit`, `Socket_ModuleStage`, `Socket_AudioOperations`.
- These sockets are presentation references only and never own targeting, collision, movement, transport or production truth.
- Identification Tile placement, icon silhouette, portrait camera and reduced-presentation fallback remain `HOLD — PRESENTATION AUDIT REQUIRED`.

## H. Insight and decision ledger

- Verified fact: stable identity, source evidence and the source-supported assemblies cited above.
- Canon-derived interpretation: gameplay function, adaptation boundary, contact behavior and presentation drivers are explicitly labeled in the contract.
- Remaining source/design decisions:
  - Exact 7315/7690 donor modules require director approval as one explained composition.
- Cross-roster silhouette and game-director review remain open; this contract does not authorize production modeling.

## I. Build handoff

1. Retain the audited evidence and every explicit adaptation boundary.
2. Greybox hero masses, openings and structural load path from the semantic map.
3. Validate named pivots, contacts and sockets in the real gameplay camera.
4. Author only the specified reusable textures after human material review.
5. Run the game-director blind review on the 24/44/72-cell silhouette draft and revise any failed distinction.

**State:** `HOLD`

**Approving reviewer:** game director, not yet requested for this packet.
